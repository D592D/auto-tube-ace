# Netlify Deployment Checklist ✅

## Pre-Deployment Setup

### ✅ Repository Configuration
- [x] `netlify.toml` configuration file created
- [x] `frontend/public/_redirects` backup redirect rules
- [x] Vite config optimized for production builds
- [x] Environment variables documented in `.env.example`

### ⚠️ Required Actions Before Deploy

#### 1. Environment Variables
Set these in Netlify Dashboard (Site Settings → Environment Variables):
- [ ] `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
- [ ] `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Your Supabase anonymous key  
- [ ] `VITE_REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` - Your deployed backend API URL

#### 2. Backend Deployment
- [ ] Deploy Python FastAPI backend to Railway/Render/Heroku
- [ ] Set up MongoDB database (MongoDB Atlas recommended)
- [ ] Update backend environment variables (`MONGO_URL`, `DB_NAME`)
- [ ] Test backend API endpoints

#### 3. Update Configuration Files
- [ ] Update `netlify.toml` line 26: Replace `https://your-backend-url.com` with actual backend URL
- [ ] Update `frontend/public/_redirects` line 2: Replace backend URL
- [ ] Verify Supabase project is configured and accessible

## Netlify Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
1. [ ] Connect GitHub repository to Netlify
2. [ ] Netlify will auto-detect `netlify.toml` configuration
3. [ ] Set environment variables in Netlify dashboard
4. [ ] Deploy automatically on git push to main branch

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
1. [ ] Run `cd frontend && npm run build` locally
2. [ ] Drag and drop `frontend/build` folder to Netlify dashboard
3. [ ] Configure environment variables
4. [ ] Set up custom domain if needed

## Post-Deployment Testing

- [ ] Frontend loads correctly at Netlify URL
- [ ] React Router navigation works (no 404s)
- [ ] API calls are proxied correctly to backend
- [ ] Supabase authentication works
- [ ] All environment variables are loaded
- [ ] Console shows no critical errors

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Fails
- Check Node.js version is 18+
- Verify all dependencies are in package.json
- Check build logs in Netlify dashboard

### 404 Errors on Routes
- Verify `_redirects` file is in `frontend/public/`
- Check SPA redirect rule is working

### API Calls Fail
- Verify backend is deployed and accessible
- Check API proxy redirect in netlify.toml
- Ensure CORS is configured in FastAPI backend

### Environment Variables Not Working
- Double-check variable names start with `VITE_`
- Verify they're set in Netlify dashboard
- Rebuild after adding new environment variables

## Performance Optimization ⚡

The build is already optimized with:
- ✅ Code splitting for vendor/UI/utils
- ✅ Asset optimization and caching
- ✅ ESBuild minification
- ✅ Security headers configured
- ✅ Gzip compression enabled

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:
1. Set up custom domain in Netlify
2. Configure SSL certificate (automatic with Netlify)
3. Set up monitoring and analytics
4. Configure branch deployments for staging
